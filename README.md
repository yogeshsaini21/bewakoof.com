## Challenges

1.As every journey has some challenges and so was ours. We faced challenges to make a more secure user interface. We implemented some major authentication and autherization functionality due to which sometimes
it became very complicated to login a user then we change the structure and made a good user interface to login.


2.We faced some problems during merging the files but we figured it out very quickly and start following the basic steps of merging.


3.We faced challenges with CSS tags like absolute and relative.We aligned Navigation bar with all the pages by giving it proper margin and padding.
